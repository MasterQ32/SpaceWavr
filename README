# SpaceWavr

SpaceWavr (read: *Space Waver*) is a simplified implementation of [SpaceWar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) or [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))
for an 8 bit AVR microcontroller.

The game requires special hardware that needs some explanation (one day). In short:
8-Bit-DAC at Port B (X deflection) and Port D (Y deflection) is used to paint a beam
on an XY mode oscilloscope.
